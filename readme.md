#Mike Murphy's Splitter Contract.

At this point, the contract is all hard-coded and it only writes out
to the console.log()

To Do List:
1) Get the constructor to set Bob and Carol's addresses to account[1] and account[2]
2) Create a test to test the constructor settings (Bob, Carol's address)
3) Create a test to get the balance for Alice, Bob and Carol.
3) Get the split() so that it can use the state variables for Bob and Carol's address.
4) Create a test to exercise the split.
