#Mike Murphys God Awful Splitter Contract.

At this point, the contract is all hard-coded and it only writes out
to the console.log()

As of this time, everything seems to deploy. But when I run split, the balances don't change for Alice, Bob or Carol.

I just realize the difficult part about this.  You won't be able to test this on your instance because the accounts are hard coded.
